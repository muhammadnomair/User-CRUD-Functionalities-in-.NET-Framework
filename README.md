# User CRUD Functionalities in .NET Framework

This project is a desktop application built using the .NET Framework and C# to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user management. It serves as a foundational tool for understanding how data operations can be implemented in a .NET desktop environment.

### Key Features:
**1. Create Users:** Allows the creation of new user records, capturing details such as username, email, contact information, and other relevant fields.

**2. Read Users:** Fetches and displays the list of users stored in the system, with detailed information displayed in a user-friendly interface. The data can be queried for specific users or filtered based on various parameters.

**3. Update Users:** Provides the functionality to edit and update the details of existing users, ensuring that the system always has up-to-date information.

**4. Delete Users:** Enables the deletion of user records from the system, ensuring a seamless process for managing user data lifecycle.

### Technical Stack:
**Programming Language:** C#

**Framework:** .NET Framework

**Database:** The backend data storage can be handled through local databases such as Microsoft SQL Server or SQLite, demonstrating integration between C# and relational databases.

**UI Framework:** Windows Forms (WinForms) for a robust, responsive user interface that simplifies user management.
